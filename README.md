# SHERLOCK-AI : Copying Sherlock Holmes with Visual Abductive Reasoning  

This project is deeply inspired by Sherlock Holmes, who is a fictional character capable of deducing interesting stuffs just by observing some visual clues. In this project, I will try my best to replicate that amazing ability, using the SHERLOCK dataset and SOTA open-source Visual Language Model (LLaVA).
